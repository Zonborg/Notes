# NotesWebApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.4.

## Background information

This project was created for me to try and learn new technologies.  In this case Angular.  This simple app will then talk to a 
Spring Boot microservice, which will itself then store data in MongoDB.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
